        "main_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality reference image of a solid 18k yellow gold ring mounting, depicted without gemstones. The object consists of a circular band with a D-shaped cross-section that transitions at the top into a linear gallery containing four empty circular basket settings. Each setting features vertical prongs rising from the bridge, designed to hold round stones. The metal surface is highly polished, reflective, and smooth, showing a lustrous gold sheen. The image clearly displays the four empty cavities (seats) and the structural prongs. The interior of the band is smooth.",
