  "overall_description": "A high-polish yellow gold ring featuring a partial eternity style setting with four round-cut green gemstones (emeralds or tsavorites) held in a shared prong setting. The ring shank has a 'D' profile that transitions into a basket gallery structure. The interior of the shank features an engraving reading 'adhav'.",

The object is a ring shank that transitions into a high-profile shared-prong setting head designed to hold four round gemstones. The metal surface is highly polished yellow gold with a mirror-like finish. The shank has a rounded outer profile and a flat interior. The setting area features delicate vertical prongs rising from a gallery rail, creating four distinct circular seats (bearings) for stones. The view should clearly show the empty prongs and the structural bridge underneath where the stones would sit. The shape is elegant and architectural.",
