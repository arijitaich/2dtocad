  "reasoning": "Image 3 is selected as the best candidate because it satisfies the critical technical requirements for 3D reconstruction better than the others. While Image 2 has a classic isometric angle, its textured background and significant blur (depth of field) on the rear of the ring would confuse reconstruction algorithms. Image 3 provides a clear perspective view that defines the object's shape and volume effectively, but crucially maintains a clean, solid background and sharp focus across the entire object, ensuring accurate edge detection and geometry extraction.",
