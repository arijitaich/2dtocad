The design features a continuous band that transitions into a setting head at the top. The setting area consists of four circular stone seats arranged in a row. Vertical prong structures rise between the seats to form a shared-prong mechanism. The side profile of the gallery features U-shaped cutouts beneath each stone seat position to allow light entry. The shank profile is rounded (D-shape) and smooth. The interior of the band is smooth and cylindrical. 3/4 view angle to show both the side profile and the top cavities for the stones.",
