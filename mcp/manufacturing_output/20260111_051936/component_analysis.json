The bottom of the band is a smooth, solid half-round shank. The top half transitions into a setting gallery containing seven empty circular seats arranged in a slight arc. Between each circular seat are vertical, unbent prong pillars standing upright. The side profile of the gallery features U-shaped open windows beneath each seat to allow light entry. The surface is highly reflective gold metal. Focus on the geometry of the empty prong settings and the structural integrity of the bridge.",

  "additional_notes": "The critical manufacturing tolerance lies in the gallery spacing. The shared prongs must be thick enough to hold two stones simultaneously but thin enough not to obscure the gems. Digital reconstruction should focus on the empty mounting state to accurately capture the prong geometry before they are bent over the stones."
