The object is a single solid metal piece consisting of a smooth, polished circular band that tapers upward into a bridge containing seven empty circular collets (seats). Between each seat are vertical metal prongs standing upright. The side profile reveals a 'U' shaped gallery under each setting seat. The material is 18k yellow gold with a highly reflective, mirror-like polish. The structure is symmetrical and precise, designed for jewelry casting.",
