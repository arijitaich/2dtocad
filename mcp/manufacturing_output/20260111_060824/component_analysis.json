        "main_prompt": "A single isolated 3D model of an empty gold ring mounting without gemstones. The object is a ring shank that transitions into a setting area with seven empty circular seats for stones. Between each seat are vertical metal prongs standing upright. The side profile of the setting area features a scalloped, open gallery structure allowing light through. The bottom of the shank is a smooth, high-polish half-round band. Material is 18k yellow gold with a highly reflective metallic surface. The stone seats are recessed and clearly defined.",
