        "main_prompt": "A single isolated 18k yellow gold ring mount setting, devoid of gemstones. The object is a circular ring shank that thickens at the top to form a bridge containing seven adjacent circular seats for stones. Vertical gold prongs rise between each seat, currently standing straight up in an un-set position. The side profile reveals a scalloped under-gallery with U-shaped openings allowing light through the side. The metal is highly reflective, smooth, and polished yellow gold. The bottom of the shank is a simple tapered D-profile band.",
