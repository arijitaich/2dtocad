The object is a single continuous metal piece consisting of a polished circular shank that transitions into a top setting bar. The setting area contains seven circular seats (holes) arranged in a row, separated by vertical metal prongs. From the side view, the setting features U-shaped scalloped cutouts (gallery) beneath each seat. The metal has a highly reflective 18k gold finish. No gemstones are present; this is the raw metal casting. The prongs are upright and un-bent.",
