The object is a continuous ring shank that thickens at the top to form a bridge setting. The top section features seven circular recessed seats prepared for round stones, but currently empty. Separating each seat are vertical, rectangular gold bars (shared prongs) standing upright. The side profile of the bridge features U-shaped open gallery cutouts beneath each setting seat to allow light through. The shank has a smooth, semi-domed 'comfort fit' profile. The surface is flawless, mirror-polished gold with strong specular highlights.",

The stone features a vibrant, deep green color with slight internal translucency characteristic of high-quality emeralds.

If 3D printed for casting, supports must be placed on the inside of the shank, not the gallery. Stones are set by pushing the vertical gold bars of Component 1 over the girdles of Component 2."
