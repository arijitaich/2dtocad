        "main_prompt": "A single isolated 3D model view of a gold ring mounting without gemstones. The object is an 18k yellow gold ring shank. The bottom half is a solid, smooth polished band with a D-shaped cross-section. The top half transitions into a setting structure featuring a row of vertical prongs and empty circular seats prepared for stone setting. The interior of the band is smooth gold with the word 'adhav' deeply engraved into the metal surface. The metal has a high-gloss reflective finish. The view shows the side profile clearly.",
