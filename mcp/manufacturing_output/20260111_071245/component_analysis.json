        "main_prompt": "A single isolated 3D model of an empty yellow gold ring mounting. The object is a continuous piece of metal consisting of a polished half-round shank that transitions into a seven-stone gallery setting at the top. The setting area contains seven circular seats (bezels) with vertical shared prongs rising between each seat. There are no gemstones present, only the empty metal framework. The side profile reveals a scalloped 'U' shape gallery allowing light through the side. The material is 18k yellow gold with a high-gloss mirror polish, showing realistic metallic reflections and smooth surface continuity.",

Manufacturing requires high-precision casting to ensuring prong tips are substantial enough to be bent over the stone girdles without cracking."
