The top gallery features seven circular empty basket seats arranged in a row. Vertical gold prongs rise between the empty seats in a shared-prong configuration. The metal surface is highly polished and reflective. The side profile shows open scallop detailing beneath each stone seat to allow light entry. The inside of the band is smooth and hallmarked.",
