The design features a shank that transitions into a top gallery containing seven empty circular seats (bezels) arranged in a row. Between each seat are vertical prongs standing upright. The side profile of the gallery shows U-shaped openwork bridges (basket style) connecting the prongs. The geometry is smooth, symmetrical, and metallic.",
