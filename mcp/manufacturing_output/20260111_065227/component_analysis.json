The object consists of a tapered circular band (shank) that widens at the top into a curved setting gallery. The gallery features seven circular open-work seats or baskets arranged in a row. Vertical gold prongs rise between the seat positions to hold stones. The surface is highly polished yellow gold with strong specular highlights and metallic reflections. The inner band is smooth and convex. Show the empty metal framework clearly.",
