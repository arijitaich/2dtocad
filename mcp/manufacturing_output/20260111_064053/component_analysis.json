        "main_prompt": "A photorealistic 3D render of an empty ring mounting casting, isolated on a neutral background. The object is made of polished 18k yellow gold. It features a curved bridge across the top with seven circular empty seats (recesses) prepared to receive round gemstones. Between each seat are vertical, un-tipped gold prongs standing upright, ready for setting. The under-gallery (side view of the setting) shows open u-shaped latticework detailing. The shank is a smooth, tapered band with a semi-circular cross-section. High metallic reflectivity, smooth surface topology, no gemstones present.",
